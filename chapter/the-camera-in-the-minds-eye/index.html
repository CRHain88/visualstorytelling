                    <p>Whether you ace a director, camera operator, or comics artist, you have co make conscious decisions about all aspects of "shot" composition, including how far away the "camera" will be, what vantage point the spectator wiil see the action from, and how distance and camera angle will change from shot to shot as the scene progresses. The vantage point of the spectator, or point of view, will in turn determine the perspective, how the objects in the frame appear relative to the homon line. Decisions made about how to frame a scene for a screen or panel will determine whether the shot will enhance or detract from narrative power.</p>
                    <p>Deciding where to place the camera in each shot should never be arbitrary. Camera angles provide narrative focus for the artist. For example, a worm's eye view of a standing subject makes that person appear tall and domineering. A down shot accomplishes the reverse and diminishes the same person. Whenever possible, camera angles should be motivated - camera placement is, in a sense, where the reader is placed </p>

                    <p>This is one of the many common framing techniques that span all visual storytelling media. It is used to orient the viewer to where the character(s) are, who the character(s) are, and the spatial relationship between characters and their environment. It is also used to depict vistas and as an ESTABLISHING LONG SHOT. In comic books and interactive games, these are drawn from such a great distance away that object details, such as cars or people, are not clearly visible.</p>

                    <p>When the camera moves into or away from the subject, described as <span class="visual-header visual-header--heavy">Dolly In</span> or <span class="visual-header visual-header--heavy">Dolly Out</span>. This one is usually film specific and can be confused with "<span class="visual-header visual-header--heavy">Zoom Shot</span>."

                    <p>Zooming, along with and instant-to-instant form of shot, can be a great device if used correctly. It is an easy way to show movement, even if none is taking place. You can also use it to build suspense, drama or to force a reader to focus in on something or someone specifically. Some interesting uses of zooming are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Zoom in as a character approaches the picture plane.</li>
                        <li>Zoom out as a figure recedes into the panel.</li>
                        <li>Great way to show danger, etc. - close in as you zoom in on something/one.</li>
